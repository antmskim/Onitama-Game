# Onitama Game Project

This repository contains the implementation of the **Onitama Game**, developed as part of one of my assignments at the **University of Toronto**.

## Project Overview

Onitama is a strategy board game, and this project involved building a software version of the game using Python. The project focuses on the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and requires designing a modular and well-documented codebase. Additionally, thorough testing was implemented to ensure that the game functions as expected.

## What I Learned

Through this assignment, I developed several key software engineering skills:

- **OOP Design**: I learned to create flexible, reusable, and scalable software using classes and objects, following OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Documentation**: I gained experience in writing clear and detailed documentation for my code, ensuring that it is understandable to other developers.
- **Testing**: I implemented various testing strategies to validate the game's functionality and ensure that all edge cases are handled effectively.
- **Software Design**: This project taught me how to approach software development from a high-level design perspective, including creating a well-structured architecture for the game and considering maintainability.

## Features

- Fully functional implementation of the Onitama board game.
- Support for human vs human and AI-based gameplay.
- Customizable rules and styles based on the game's original design.
- Unit tests to verify game logic and ensure smooth gameplay.

## How to Run

To run the game, clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main game file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
